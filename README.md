# ITunesTracksStore
This smal demo, was a challenge from a technical interview i failed, becuase much of 
the architecture and tools asked at the moment, were out of my expertise.

Nowadays, i can face the challenge as it were. The technical challenge was comething like that:
(i'm pulling it out from my memory of 2 years ago)

- Build an iTunes track browser, consuming from the iTunes API
- build it with Clean Architecture, implementing TDD. UI could be handled with MVP o MVVM
- put a pager for your results
- if a track is clicked, a screen with the details of the track is displayed
- if the thumbnail of the track is clicked, a mini player should be displayed

obviously, in a technical interview, it's not expected to make ALL of this, so just 
focus on the "functiona√± demo" you can make with the time given
